## Loan Eligibility Prediction Model

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on various applicant features. By leveraging Python and popular machine learning libraries, this project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, training, and evaluating predictive models for financial data analysis.

### Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive analysis of loan application data to understand distributions, trends, and correlations.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling of missing values through imputation and transformation techniques.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features, such as total income and log-transformed loan amounts, to enhance model performance.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implementation of multiple classification algorithms including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests.
- **Model Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search with cross-validation to optimize model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance assessment using accuracy and confusion matrix visualization.

### Data Description
